	 <h1>Sabrina Carpenter</h1>

	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The cursor turns into a black perfume bottle and when you hover over a link a white line crosses over the word. I like that there's an effect when you hover over a link. It turns into a regualar cursor when you hover over the title "Sabrina Carpenter 2025" but that's not a hyperlink so I find that to be confusing. After clicking on links the navigation bar to take you back to the homepage stays visible which is nice, but after clicking on some links like "tours" or "merch" the "home" link takes you to a different home page and you have to use the back button to go back to the original homepage. </p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Very easy to use. The homepage is very simple with a navigation bar in the top left. You're able to click on the different links and they take you wherever you need to go. You also have links in the bottom corner that take you to social media and across the bottom of the page you have links to take you to more professional and in depth policies.  </p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The main page is promoting her latest album so the centered text which takes the most attention is the name of her most recent album "man's best friend." The name of the artist is written in a gold font which the font is pretty but the color fades too much into the background. The navigation at the top left and the policy information at the bottom is organized nicely but the social media links are weirdly stacked in the corner. It would've made more sense to have them on par with the navigation bar in the top right, make a page for all the socials, or make them the same font as the legal policy at the bottom </p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Overall the look and feel is well designed. The font is consistent all throughout and it matches the vibe of the collaged picture behind it.</p>
